## 📋 Paper Structure & Content

### Abstract (250 words)
```
Domain-specific question answering systems face a fundamental choice between 
parameter-efficient fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). 
While fine-tuning adapts model weights to domain patterns, RAG maintains 
interpretability through external knowledge retrieval. This work presents 
the first systematic empirical comparison of QLoRA fine-tuning versus RAG 
for legal question answering using the Indian Legal dataset (7,130 documents) 
and Mistral-7B architecture.

Our comprehensive evaluation across computational efficiency, response quality, 
interpretability, and practical deployment reveals that RAG achieves superior 
overall performance (7.4/10) compared to fine-tuning (6.7/10). RAG excels 
in source attribution (100% vs 0%), deployment speed (immediate vs 30 minutes), 
and knowledge updates (dynamic vs retraining required), while fine-tuning 
achieves faster inference (0.5s vs 3.5s per query). 

Key contributions include: (1) novel application of QLoRA to legal document 
processing with 0.12% parameter efficiency, (2) legal-aware document chunking 
strategy optimized for retrieval, (3) systematic evaluation framework comparing 
interpretable vs black-box approaches, and (4) evidence-based decision framework 
for practitioners. Our memory-efficient implementations enable deployment on 
consumer hardware (16GB RAM), democratizing access to sophisticated legal AI.

Results demonstrate that RAG's interpretability and deployment flexibility 
outweigh fine-tuning's inference speed advantages for legal applications 
requiring transparency, frequent updates, and regulatory compliance.
